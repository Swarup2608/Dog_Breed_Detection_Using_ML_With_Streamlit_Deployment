# Dog_Breed_Detection_Using_ML_With_Streamlit_Deployment
IN THIS PROJECT, WE WILL SEE HOW TO USE KERAS AND TENSORFLOW TO BUILD, TRAIN, AND TEST A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING THE BREED OF A DOG IN A SUPPLIED IMAGE. THIS IS A SUPERVISED LEARNING PROBLEM, SPECIFICALLY A MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM.

# Steps involved in the process
1. LOADING THE DATA FROM KAGGLE.

2. LOAD LABELS CSV FOR LABELS THAT CONTAIN IMAGE ID AND BREED

3. CHECKING THE BREED COUNT

4. ONE-HOT ENCODING ON LABELS DATA PREDIC.TION COLUMN

5. LOAD THE IMAGES, CONVERT THEM TO AN ARRAY, AND NORMALIZE THEM.

6. CHECKED THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE X AND Y DATA

7. BUILDING THE MODEL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE.

3. SPLIT THE DATA AND FIT IT INTO THE MODEL AND CREATE AN ACCURACY PLOT

9. EVALUATE THE MODEL FOR ACCURACY SCORE

10. USING THE MODEL FOR PREDICTION.
